				A "terminal" or "terminus" is a station at the end of a railway line. Trains arriving there have to end their journeys (terminate) or reverse out of the station. Many terminus stations have underground rapid-transit urban rail stations beneath, to transit passengers to the local city or district.
				[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A terminus is frequently, but not always, the final destination of trains arriving at the station. However a number of cities, especially in continental Europe, have a terminus as their main railway stations, and all main lines converge on this station.
