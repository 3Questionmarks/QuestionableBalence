			<Text>Fishing is an ancient practice that dates back to at least the beginning of the Paleolithic period about 40,000 years ago.  Isotopic analysis of the skeletal remains of Tianyuan man, a 40,000 year old modern human from eastern Asia, has shown that he regularly consumed freshwater fish.  Archaeology features such as shell middens, discarded fish bones and cave paintings show that sea foods were important for survival and consumed in significant quantities. During this period, most people lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and were, of necessity, constantly on the move. However, where there are early examples of permanent settlements, they are almost always associated with fishing as a major source of food.</Text>

				Mysticism is popularly known as becoming one with God or the Absolute, but may refer to any kind of ecstasy or altered state of consciousness which is given a religious or spiritual meaning. It may also refer to the attainment of insight in ultimate or hidden truths, and to human transformation supported by various practices and experiences.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The term "mysticism" has Ancient Greek origins with various historically determined meanings.Derived from the Greek word μύω múō, meaning "to close" or "to conceal", mysticism referred to the biblical, liturgical, spiritual, and contemplative dimensions of early and medieval Christianity. During the early modern period, the definition of mysticism grew to include a broad range of beliefs and ideologies related to "extraordinary experiences and states of mind."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]-- Wikipedia

			<Text>
				Code of Laws – a (more-or-less) systematic compilation of pronouncements that purports to (more-or-less) exhaustively cover what is and isn’t acceptable in a society – have been a feature of civilization since the ancient kingdoms of the Middle East. The Sumerian Code of Ur-Nammu (c. 2100 BC) and the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi (c. 1760 BC) are the earliest known codes, letting the citizens know how their ruler felt about misbehavior. The old Hebrew Written and Oral Torah (c. 1330 BC) laid out the law – religious and civil – for God’s Chosen People. But it was those paragons of organization that really formalized the concept, with the Corpus Juris Civilis (drafted 529 to 534 AD) of the emperor Justinian, of setting down how to deal with every dispute or … well, everything. In China, the last exclusive imperial code of laws was the Great Qing Legal Code with its 1907 statutes; despite some 30 revisions, it held sway over the civilization from 1644 to 1912.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Codes of Laws naturally conflict with an idea of autocracy - a rule by one individual's judgement. This, for instance, shaped early Chinese debates. Should, as Confucius argued, rulers be bound by a general code, or should, as Legalist scholars argued, the ruler be free of such burdens? The debate became settled over time in China, but in Europe medieval notions of divine rule made adoption of such codes scarce. But as feudalism faded and strange ideas of equality and nationalism percolated, a new generation of codes was spawned, exemplified by the Prussian Code (1794), the Code Napoleon (1804) and the German Civil Code (1896). The latter two have served as the model for the majority of modern codes in current use. Too, most codes now have two distinctive elements: a civil code to settle disputes between citizens, and a criminal or penal code to take care of those who won’t behave.

				Trade involves the transfer of goods and services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. Economists refer to a system or network that allows trade as a market.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE].Traders generally negotiate through a medium of credit or exchange, such as money. Though some economists characterize barter (i.e. trading things without the use of money) as an early form of trade, money was invented before written history began. Consequently, any story of how money first developed is mostly based on conjecture and logical inference. Letters of credit, paper money, and non-physical money have greatly simplified and promoted trade as buying can be separated from selling, or earning. Trade between two traders is called bilateral trade, while trade involving more than two traders is called multilateral trade. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE] --Wikipedia

				Sovereignty, short for "popular sovereignty," is the belief that the state belongs to the people, and that the rulers are "servants" to the people. Power derives from the people, and those who rule do so with the people's consent. Popular sovereignty can be most easily contrasted with a theocracy, in which the ruler derives his power from God, not from the people. Nations with popular sovereignty usually have some form of periodic elections in which the people can express their will, hopefully voting for the best candidate, rather than say the tallest or the best liar.

				While many ships are engineered to cross oceans quickly or take the greatest amount of cargo in the smallest possible space, warships were designed for one purpose alone - destroying other ships. Besides obviously being armed with some form of weapon (traditionally things like cannons or rams), warships can also withstand more damage and are much more maneuverable than something like a merchant or passenger vessel. As naval technologies have advanced, so has the warship. Galleys and triremes were early forms of warships capable of ramming enemy vessels, but usually combat was performed by the army on board. However, once cannon became capable of quick reloads, large sail-driven ships were employed which held rows of cannons along each side of the craft. Eventually these wooden ships were given up for ones made of iron and steel, and sails were abandoned for steam and nuclear power. While modern warships bear little resemblance to the earliest galleys, they still keep to the same basic design principles - be capable of destroying the other guy first, before he can take out you.

				Urbanism is the study of how inhabitants of urban areas, such as towns and cities, interact with the built environment. It is a direct component of disciplines such as urban planning, a profession focusing on the design and management of urban areas, and urban sociology, an academic field which studies urban life.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Many architects, planners, geographers, and sociologists investigate the way people live in densely populated urban areas. There is a wide variety of different theories and approaches to the study of urbanism. However, in some contexts internationally, urbanism is synonymous with urban planning, and urbanist refers to an urban planner.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The term urbanism originated in the late nineteenth century with the Spanish civil engineer Ildefons Cerdà, whose intent was to create an autonomous activity focused on the spatial organization of the city. Urbanism's emergence in the early 20th century was associated with the rise of centralized manufacturing, mixed-use neighborhoods, social organizations and networks, and what has been described as "the convergence between political, social and economic citizenship".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Urbanism can be understood as placemaking and the creation of place identity at a citywide level, however as early as 1938 Louis Wirth wrote that it is necessary to stop 'identify[ing] urbanism with the physical entity of the city', go 'beyond an arbitrary boundary line' and consider how 'technological developments in transportation and communication have enormously extended the urban mode of living beyond the confines of the city itself.' -- Wikipedia

				A metropolis is a large city or conurbation which is a significant economic, political, and cultural area for a country or region, and an important hub for regional or international connections, commerce, and communications. A big city belonging to a larger urban agglomeration, but which is not the core of that agglomeration, is not generally considered a metropolis but a part of it. The plural of the word is metropolises, although the Latin plural is metropoles, from the Greek metropoleis. For urban areas outside metropolitan areas that generate a similar attraction on a smaller scale for their region, the concept of the regiopolis ("regio" for short) was introduced by urban and regional planning researchers in Germany in 2006.

				Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can perform as well or better than humans on a wide range of cognitive tasks, as opposed to narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks. It is one of various definitions of strong AI.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Creating AGI is a primary goal of AI research and of companies such as OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic. A 2020 survey identified 72 active AGI R and D projects spread across 37 countries.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The timeline for AGI development remains a subject of ongoing debate among researchers and experts. As of 2023, some argue that it may be possible in years or decades; others maintain it might take a century or longer; and a minority believe it may never be achieved. There is debate on the exact definition of AGI, and regarding whether modern large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 are early, incomplete forms of AGI. AGI is a common topic in science fiction and futures studies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Contention exists over the potential for AGI to pose a threat to humanity; for example, OpenAI claims to treat it as an existential risk, while others find the development of AGI to be too remote to present a risk.
